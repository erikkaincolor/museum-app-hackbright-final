## About Project and about Erikka
*Habitual be*, also called *invariant be*, is the use of an uninflected "be" in Black and Caribbean English to mark habitual or extended actions in place of the Standard English "is" and "are". 

A generic version of my discovery app is [`Google Arts & Culture`](https://artsandculture.google.com/partner "Google Arts & Culture"), which doesn't provide museum audio or give ethnic art, *no matter the region*, the distinct voice each deserves. I solved this with my app!

It is my hope that other ethnic groups create repositories that are similar...for [`ethnographic research`](https://anthropology.princeton.edu/undergraduate/what-ethnography
 "Princeton definiton") and for accurate and unique "from the horse's mouth" portrayal. 

I am an artist, museum-frequenter, member at *Museum of Fine Arts, Houston* and MFAH's 5A (African American Art Advisory Association) chapter. I hsve my B.S. in Digital Media Innovation, minor in Industrial Design and *now* am a Software Engineer interested in learning more about system architecture, product management, and the backend.

## Features
- `As a museum-frequenter`, I want access to a repo of museum locations, museum-specific audio guides, and curated related sounds so that my solo visits are fully immersive and more impactful.

- `As an art observer`, I'd value favoriting art ,the collections, related sounds, and museums I see on the app.

- `As an art curator`, I want access to an audio guide standardization proposal and mockup so that I can have a starting place for research into my museumâ€™s audio guide initiative and possibly a chance to curate virtual exhibits.

- `As an artist`, I want all these app features!
