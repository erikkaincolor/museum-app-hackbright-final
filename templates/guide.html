        <strong>Take an Audio Guide Tour!</strong>
        <p>Background: Sometimes we dont know what we're looking at when we go to a museum. Hear from collection curators, Ted Talk's, the artist themselves, friends, family, the community, and Master's degree Art students and peer deeper with art-related audio.

        <h1>Mobile-First Audio Guide</h1>    
        <p class="mobile-audio-p">The practice of passing on knowledge through oral history can be traced back to the centuries-old griot traditions in West African cultures.<br><br> While early African societies kept meticulous records, including the treasured <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-60689699">Timbuktu manuscripts</a> in Mali, Africa, oral history was also considered an essential resource for preserving history, time, space and art.<br><br>Listen to <strong>artists, the community, graduate-degree students in the Arts, curators, and others</strong> speak about
            HabitualBeâ€™s and our partner museum's collections and the art each of them hold.
